# ChangeFont19

Changes Font 19 in Geometry Dash to the official Minecraft font (or a fan-made monospace variant, if you want to head in that direction).
Applies across all graphics settings; use the highest graphics settings for best results.

- [YellowCat98](https://github.com/YellowCat98) for suggesting [Sprite Font Builder](https://www.johnwordsworth.com/projects/sprite-font-builder) to generate the resources.
- [John Wordsworth](https://www.johnwordsworth.com), for making [Sprite Font Builder](https://www.johnwordsworth.com/projects/sprite-font-builder).
- [IdreesInc](https://github.com/IdreesInc) for the fan-made monospace variant, reused and modified with permission granted by the Open Font License v1.1 (OFLv1.1).

Additional thanks to [Magpipe](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4NJ3nwh1oG9IeS64vyoPwQ) for publishing Subwoofer Lullaby (the level) and making it easier to test font sizes.
Thanks to [Mojang](https://mojang.com) for releasing Minecraft and for making such an iconic font.

This [Geode mod](https://geode-sdk.org) is licensed under GPLv3, with the [bundled fan-made monospace variant](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft) by IdreesInc licensed under OFLv1.1.

Due to the nature of how the source code was written, v1.0.0 of this mod was not licensed under LGPLv2 (or any other copyleft license).
However, in the (rare) case that you (still) wish to re-use v1.0.0's source code to any extent, here's the exact wording from Alphalaneous themself:

> I should really start adding licenses to my projects, cuz like go ahead and use it, as long as you arenâ€™t doing so to deceive or scam people in any way lol

For historical purposes: v1.1.0 was licensed under LGPLv2, and v1.2.0 and onwards are licensed under a combination of GPLv3 and OFLv1.1.

*Notice: No portion of this project is affiliated with Minecraft, Mojang, or IdreesInc in any way and is exclusively a fan project. This project bundles `.png` and `.fnt` derivatives of a [fan-made monospace variant](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft) by [IdreesInc](https://github.com/IdreesInc) which were generated with user input using [Sprite Font Builder](https://www.johnwordsworth.com/projects/sprite-font-builder) by [John Wordsworth](https://www.johnwordsworth.com), but it does not include any assets, font files, or `.ttf` files from the original Minecraft game or from IdreesInc.*

*Less important notice: the monospace font styles are (un)fortunately not truly monospaced due to how [Sprite Font Builder](https://www.johnwordsworth.com/projects/sprite-font-builder) treats `.ttf` files. However, there are still some differences from the original Minecraft font--try them out!*

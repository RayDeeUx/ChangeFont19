# ChangeFont19 Changelog
## v1.3.1
- iPhone and iPads (and maybe iPods?) are now able to enjoy ChangeFont19!
  - However, iOS Geode users see the fallback Font 19 included in this mod more often compared to macOS Geode users.
## v1.3.0
- Port to 2.2074.
## v1.2.0 - Partially Sponsored by Cvolton
- Added Font Styles. Styles include:
  - None/Classic (To keep the font style from v1.1.0 and v1.0.0)
  - Stronger Stroke (For levels using Font 19 under incredibly small scales, or easier reading in general)
  - Shadow (Emulating the shadow style from the original Minecraft game while keeping the stroke effect seen in most fonts in Geometry Dash)
  - Monospace (Based on assets made by [and courtesy of] [IdreesInc](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft), licensed under the permissive [OFLv1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/))
  - Monospace Shadow (Based on assets made by [and courtesy of] [IdreesInc](https://github.com/IdreesInc/Monocraft), licensed under the permissive [OFLv1.1](https://openfontlicense.org/))
  - <cy>*Note that Font Styles will not apply to Item Counter objects in-game due to technical limitations, and will fall back to the default font style seen in versions 1.1.0 and 1.0.0 of this mod.*</c>
  - <cy>*Big thank you to [undefined000](https://github.com/undefined000) for diagnosing a crash during this update's development!*</c>

- Re-revise developers list to reflect changes in how Font 19 is changed.
- Re-generate Classic style assets based on the default character set provided by Sprite Font Builder to minimize crashes. (Potentially. `.fnt` files are still mostly unexplored territory for me, please be gentle!)
- Re-made the logo to reflect new features, using assets lent by Alphalaneous.
